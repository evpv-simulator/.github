**The EVPV-simulator (Electric Vehicles - PhotoVoltaics Simulator) model is an open-source Python tool designed to calculate the spatio-temporal charging needs of privately-owned electric vehicles (EVs) and the potential for solar photovoltaics (PV) to meet these needs in a given region of interest.** 
Tailored especially for urban contexts with limited mobility data, the simulator enables the endogenous estimation of daily mobility patterns by combining georeferenced datasets with advanced spatial trip distribution models. For PV generation, it leverages the capabilities of the PVLib library and supports a range of installation archetypes (e.g., rooftop, free-standing PV, etc.)..**
